## My Own Fighting Game (Made only with JS, HTML and CSS):

**Note: This game can't be played on a mobile device since there're no keys on them.**

This is just a simple little project I've made to have some fun and learn some things about games (which is not my field). It is a reconstruction of a JS fighting game (whose is 2D and pixelated), made by Chris Courses on this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ) üòÅ.
Also, there're some changes on how the HTML & CSS is done and there're a few code snippets different from the main original code, but there is nothing that's gonna cause any difference on the game's behavior in itself.

To play it as the *player 1* or *player 2* these below are the keys you gonna use:

        
    Player 1:           Player 2:
        
    [ W ] Up            [ ‚Üë ] Up
    [ A ] Left          [ ‚Üê ] Left
    [ D ] Right         [ ‚Üí ] Right
    [ SPACE ] Attack    [ ‚Üì ] Attack
